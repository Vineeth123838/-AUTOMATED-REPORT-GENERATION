*DESCRIPTION*: This Python project focuses on automating the process of analyzing student performance data, visualizing the results, and generating a professional PDF report. The main goal of the task is to demonstrate practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and document generation using Python libraries. The script is designed to read a CSV file containing student names and their marks, calculate average marks for each student, generate a bar chart to visually represent the performance, and finally compile everything into a PDF report.

The first step in this task is data reading and processing. The script uses the pandas library to read the data.csv file, which contains the marks obtained by students in various subjects. Using pandasâ€™ powerful data manipulation functions, the script groups the data by student names and calculates the average marks for each student. This step ensures that the data is organized and ready for visualization, which is essential for understanding performance trends.

Next, the task emphasizes data visualization using matplotlib. A bar chart is generated, where each student is represented on the X-axis and their corresponding average marks are displayed on the Y-axis. The bar chart provides an intuitive way to compare student performance at a glance. The chart is saved as an image (chart.png) so that it can be easily embedded into the PDF report. Proper labeling, coloring, and figure sizing are used to make the chart clear and visually appealing.

Once the chart is ready, the script proceeds to PDF report generation using the FPDF library. The PDF includes a title, the chart image, and a short descriptive text summarizing the student performance data. The FPDF library allows precise placement of images and text, making it possible to create a professional-looking report without manual intervention. The final output is a PDF file named report.pdf, which can be shared with teachers, students, or administrators for record-keeping or evaluation purposes.

This task highlights key programming skills including reading and processing data, performing group-wise calculations, visualizing results, and generating reports programmatically. It demonstrates how Python can be used to automate repetitive tasks like report creation, saving time and reducing errors. Additionally, this project introduces best practices such as separating data, charts, and reports, and using libraries that are widely adopted in the data science and analytics industry.

Overall, Task 2 serves as a practical exercise in combining multiple Python libraries to solve a real-world problem. By the end of the task, users can generate a fully automated report that summarizes student performance, complete with visual charts and textual summaries, all in a single Python script. This task not only strengthens programming skills but also provides a tangible output that can be used in academic or professional contexts.
